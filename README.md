Peek is a web app built using Flutter that aims to help developers gain better insight into the current job market. 
The website retrieves jobs from the GraphQL Jobs API. 
The website allows users to do two different types of searches:
- Users can enter a job title (e.g. javascript developer) to get a pie chart of the skills required by jobs containing the search keyword. This search also gives a list of jobs that contain the search keyword in the title.
- Users can enter a job skill (e.g. python) to get a list of jobs that require this skill
